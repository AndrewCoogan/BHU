# BHU

Bang for Buck Housing Upgrade (BHU) is an app that empowers users to make informed decisions when looking to work on one of their most valuable assets--their home. The effort in getting contractors, materials, and rental space if the work is extensive is an expensive venture and not something that should be taken lightly. With this app, a user can provide an address in covered cities.

Currently covered cities:
  - Seattle, WA
  - Chicago, IL
